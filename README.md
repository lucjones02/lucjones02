### Hi there, I'm Luc ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently a software engineer at [Imagination Technologies](https://www.imaginationtech.com/) working in CPU Modelling. I recently graduated from [Imperial College London](https://imperial.ac.uk) studying Computer Engineering with First Class Honours and have a great interest in software and finance.
